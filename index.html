        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, I'm Sharushan, a passionate software engineer specializing in web development. I have expertise in Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and Laravel.
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout my career, I have developed a wide range of projects using various technologies. I have a strong command of Python and its frameworks, including Flask and Django. I leverage Python's simplicity and versatility to build efficient and scalable web applications, handling everything from backend systems to complex algorithms.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also have expertise in front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I create visually appealing and intuitive user interfaces to provide exceptional user experiences. With proficiency in modern front-end frameworks such as React and Vue.js, I deliver interactive and responsive web applications.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition, I have extensive experience with PHP, particularly with the Laravel framework. Laravel is my go-to choice for developing robust and feature-rich web applications. I utilize Laravel's elegant syntax and built-in tools to create scalable and secure backend systems, including RESTful APIs.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am a dedicated problem solver and a lifelong learner. I enjoy taking on challenges and staying up to date with the latest industry trends. I strive for excellence in every project, delivering clean, efficient, and maintainable code.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you're looking for a software engineer with expertise in Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and Laravel, I would love to connect and discuss how I can contribute to your projects and help bring your ideas to life.
